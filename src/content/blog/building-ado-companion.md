## TL;DR

We took the unofficial **Azure DevOps mobile app** as inspiration and rebuilt it as a **web app** — work items, pull requests, pipelines, and code — then went further: a persistent app shell, a dashboard, dark mode, and **write-back** (edit work items, approve/abandon PRs) instead of read-only.

The twist: it had to run **on Databricks Apps** (corporate policy allows Databricks, not external PaaS like Vercel), and the source of truth had to live in **Azure DevOps Repos** with a **branch-based promotion** model (dev → stg → prod). We built:

- A **React (Vite + TypeScript) + FastAPI (Python)** app, deployed as a single Databricks App.
- A **Databricks Asset Bundle** for declarative, multi-workspace deploys.
- An **Azure Pipeline** that builds and deploys on every merge, authenticating with a **service principal**.
- A **GitHub → Azure DevOps mirror** so an AI coding agent could keep working on GitHub while ADO remained the system of record.

And we hit five real bugs getting to first deploy. They're all documented below — that's the useful part.

---

## 1. The idea

The reference was a Flutter mobile client for Azure DevOps: log in, browse work items on the board, review pull requests, watch pipelines, scan commits. Useful, but mobile-only and read-mostly.

We wanted three things it didn't have:

1. **Web-first.** Accessible from any browser, embeddable later in Teams or a Mac shell.
2. **A real workflow tool.** Not just *view* work items — **edit** them. Change state, comment, approve/abandon PRs, all written back to Azure DevOps through its REST API.
3. **Analytics.** A dashboard with delivery metrics, and (eventually) natural-language Q&A over the data via **Databricks Genie**.

## 2. The constraints that shaped everything

Good architecture is mostly a response to constraints. Ours were unusually specific:

| Constraint | Consequence |
|---|---|
| **Hosting: Databricks only** (no Vercel/external PaaS) | The app runs *as a Databricks App*. Next.js/SSR buys nothing here — we chose a React SPA + FastAPI. |
| **Source of truth: Azure DevOps Repos** | CI/CD is **Azure Pipelines**, and promotion is branch-based (dev/stg/prod). |
| **Dev on a personal Databricks (Free Edition)** | Free Edition is serverless-only, non-commercial, and apps stop after 24h — fine for prototyping, not production. Everything had to be **config-swappable** to a corporate workspace. |
| **AI agent develops on GitHub** | We needed a bridge so GitHub work lands in ADO without manual syncing. |

The single most important design decision fell out of these: **separate the operational plane from the analytical plane.**

---

## 3. Architecture: two data planes

The app does two fundamentally different kinds of work, and conflating them is the classic mistake.

- The **operational plane** talks to the **live Azure DevOps REST API**: list work items, change a state, approve a PR. Low-latency, read **and** write. No copy of ADO data is stored.
- The **analytical plane** runs over **historical ADO data ingested into Delta tables** in Unity Catalog: dashboards and (later) Genie natural-language questions. Batch, read-only, aggregate.

Both are served by **one FastAPI backend** running inside the Databricks App. Crucially, the operational plane never depends on Databricks SQL or Genie — so the app stays fully usable even when the analytics warehouse is asleep or rate-limited.

## 4. The stack, and why

- **Frontend — React (Vite) SPA + TypeScript + Tailwind.** Chosen over Streamlit (we wanted a polished CRUD UX, not a data-app look) and over Next.js (SSR/edge is wasted inside a Databricks App).
- **Backend — FastAPI (Python).** First-class **Databricks SDK** for SQL/Genie/Unity Catalog, and the same process acts as the **BFF** (backend-for-frontend) to the Azure DevOps REST API via `httpx`. One backend, two planes.
- **Data fetching — TanStack Query.** Caching, invalidation, and the optimistic-or-invalidate pattern for write-back.
- **Packaging — Databricks Asset Bundles.** Declarative `databricks.yml` with per-workspace targets, so dev → prod is a config switch, not a rewrite.

The frontend is built to static assets and **served by FastAPI from the same process** — so the Databricks App is a single deployable unit.

---

## 5. Building it: Phases 0–2

We built in deliberately small, verifiable slices.

### Phase 0 — Foundation
A runnable skeleton proving the spine end-to-end: **React → FastAPI → Azure DevOps REST API**, deployable to Databricks via the Asset Bundle. Auth via a Personal Access Token stored as a Databricks secret; an org/project picker calling `/api/projects`.

### Phase 1 — Read parity
Match the mobile app: a tabbed per-project view with **Work Items** (WIQL query + batch fetch), **Pull Requests** (with a status filter), **Pipelines** (recent build runs), and **Code** (repos + commits). All read live from ADO through the BFF. Response parsing was covered by tests using a mocked HTTP transport — no live ADO needed to verify the logic.

### Phase 2 — Write-back (the part that makes it a *tool*)
This is where it stopped being a viewer:

- **Work items:** change state via an inline dropdown (JSON-Patch `PATCH`), add comments.
- **Pull requests:** approve (reviewer vote), abandon, reactivate.

Every mutation goes through the FastAPI BFF, then invalidates the relevant TanStack Query so the UI reflects the new truth, with per-row error surfacing.

<!-- 📸 Screenshot slot: The Work Items table showing the editable state pills (the colored dropdowns) and a comment composer open below the table. -->

---

## 6. The redesign: shell, dashboard, dark mode

The first cut was a centered single card. The redesign turned it into a product:

- A **persistent app shell** — left sidebar (logo, project switcher, navigation with live counts, user footer) and a top bar (breadcrumb, search, theme toggle, connection status).
- A new **Overview dashboard** — four KPI cards with sparklines, a 14-run pipeline bar chart, a work-items-by-state donut, and a recent-items table. (Built as a **client-side rollup** from data we already fetch — no new backend endpoint required for v1.)
- **Full dark mode** — implemented as a CSS-variable token swap, persisted to `localStorage`, applied before first paint to avoid a flash.

Everything is driven by a **design-token system** (light/dark values for ~40 tokens) wired into Tailwind, so theming is consistent and a single switch flips the whole app.

## 7. Multi-environment and branch-based promotion

Three workspaces (dev, stg, prod), one per environment, promoted by **protected git branches**. The Asset Bundle models this with **targets**, and — this is the key move — **all environment-specific configuration lives in per-workspace secrets**, not in files.

```yaml
# databricks.yml (excerpt)
targets:
  dev:  { mode: development }   # host resolved from the CLI/profile or pipeline vars
  stg:  { mode: production }
  prod: { mode: production }

resources:
  apps:
    ado_app:
      name: ado-companion
      source_code_path: ./src
      resources:
        - name: ado_org_url
          secret: { scope: ado, key: ado_org_url, permission: READ }
        - name: ado_pat
          secret: { scope: ado, key: ado_pat, permission: READ }
```

```yaml
# src/app.yaml — identical across all environments
env:
  - { name: ADO_ORG_URL, valueFrom: ado_org_url }
  - { name: ADO_PAT,     valueFrom: ado_pat }
```

Because the bundle and `app.yaml` are **byte-for-byte identical across branches**, promoting `dev → stg → prod` is a **pure code merge** — no config diffs, no risk of a dev URL leaking into prod.

The message: the same code marches left-to-right through protected branches; each branch deploys to its own workspace, and the only thing that differs between environments is the per-workspace secret values. Use a calm green for the workspace cylinders.</p>

## 8. CI/CD: Azure Pipelines + a service principal

The deploy pipeline triggers on a push to `dev`/`stg`/`prod`, derives the target environment from the branch name, builds the frontend, installs the Databricks CLI, validates, deploys, and starts the app. It authenticates to Databricks as a **service principal** (OAuth machine-to-machine), so no human token is in CI.

```yaml
# azure-pipelines.yml (the deploy step, abridged)
- script: |
    databricks bundle validate -t "$(targetEnv)"
    databricks bundle deploy   -t "$(targetEnv)"
    databricks bundle run ado_app -t "$(targetEnv)"
  env:
    DATABRICKS_HOST: $(DATABRICKS_HOST)
    DATABRICKS_CLIENT_ID: $(DATABRICKS_CLIENT_ID)
    DATABRICKS_CLIENT_SECRET: $(DATABRICKS_CLIENT_SECRET)
```

Color the success terminator green and the fail-fast box red; keep the middle steps neutral/grey. The intent: a guarded, linear deploy that either dead-ends early on a wrong branch or marches straight to a running app.</p>

## 9. The integration problem: GitHub ↔ Azure DevOps

Here's a wrinkle that doesn't show up in tidy architecture diagrams. The AI coding agent (Claude Code) worked against a **GitHub** repository, but the system of record was **Azure DevOps Repos**. Manually syncing the two on every change is exactly the toil you don't want.

The fix: a **GitHub Action that mirrors every push to Azure DevOps** — but *only* feature branches, never the protected `dev`/`stg`/`prod`. So the agent keeps pushing to GitHub; the branch lands in ADO automatically; and you still open a PR into a protected branch *inside ADO*, preserving the gates and the deploy pipeline.

```yaml
# .github/workflows/mirror-to-ado.yml (the push, abridged)
git push --force "https://pat:${PAT}@${ADO_REPO_HOST_AND_PATH}" \
  "HEAD:refs/heads/${BRANCH}"
```

## 10. War stories: five bugs on the road to first deploy

The architecture is the easy part to write up. The **debugging** is what actually happened — and it's the most useful thing to share. In order:

### Bug 1 — The secret reference that wasn't a path
First instinct for wiring the ADO token into the app was `valueFrom: "ado/ado_pat"` in `app.yaml`. Wrong: Databricks Apps' `valueFrom` references a **named resource** declared in the bundle, not a `scope/key` string. The fix was to declare a `secret` resource in `databricks.yml` and reference it by name (`valueFrom: ado_pat`). Lesson: **read the IaC schema; don't pattern-match from other tools.**

### Bug 2 — The mirror that asked for a username
The first mirror used a Git `http.extraheader` to inject auth. In CI it fell back to an interactive prompt and died with `could not read Username for 'https://dev.azure.com'`. Switching to **PAT-in-URL** (`https://pat:<token>@dev.azure.com/...`) and setting `GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0` made auth deterministic and failures loud.

### Bug 3 — The newline in the pasted secret
Next failure: `url contains a newline in its password component`. The PAT had been pasted into the GitHub secret **with a trailing newline** — a near-invisible copy/paste artifact. Rather than rely on a perfect paste, we **sanitize the secret in the workflow** (`tr -d '[:space:]'`). Lesson: **never trust that a secret is whitespace-clean.**

### Bug 4 — "Variable group was not found or is not authorized"
The pipeline hard-referenced an Azure DevOps **variable group** (`- group: databricks-dev`), but the credentials had been set as **pipeline variables** instead. Two different mechanisms. We dropped the required group reference so the pipeline reads from pipeline variables, and documented variable groups as the multi-workspace upgrade path. Lesson: **match the YAML to how the operator actually stored the config.**

### Bug 5 — `409 ALREADY_EXISTS: app ado-companion already exists`
The pipeline authenticated, validated, uploaded, and then hit a wall **creating the app**: it already existed. Why? An **earlier manual deploy** (run as a *human user*) had created `ado-companion`. Now the **service principal**'s bundle had no record of it, so it tried to *create* rather than *update*. The fix: delete the orphaned app and let the SP create and own it — then deploy **only through the pipeline** thereafter, so there's a single owner. Lesson: **pick one identity to own a resource; mixing a human and an SP guarantees a collision.**

<!-- 📸 Screenshot slot: Optional but great for credibility — the actual pipeline log showing the `409 ALREADY_EXISTS` error, then a follow-up screenshot of the green run after the fix. -->

<!-- 📸 Screenshot slot — THE PAYOFF: The deployed app running on its Databricks Apps URL, showing real Azure DevOps data. -->

## 11. Lessons learned

- **Constraints first.** "Databricks-only host" and "ADO is the source of truth" decided the entire stack and CI design. Name your constraints before you name your tools.
- **Separate planes.** Keeping the live operational path independent of the analytical path means the core app degrades gracefully and stays simple.
- **Config in secrets, code identical across envs.** This makes branch-based promotion a pure merge — the cleanest multi-environment story we know.
- **One owner per resource.** The 409 was entirely about a human and a service principal both trying to own the same app.
- **Automate the boring bridge.** The GitHub→ADO mirror removed a recurring manual sync and let the AI agent and the corporate process coexist.
- **The bugs are the content.** Every failure above is a thing the next person will hit. Writing them down is the highest-leverage part of the post.

---

## 12. What's next

The operational app is real today. The **analytical plane** is the next build:

1. A scheduled **OData → Delta** ingestion job to land ADO history in Unity Catalog.
2. A **Genie Space** over those tables.
3. An in-app **natural-language Q&A** panel calling the **Genie Conversation API**, plus real week-over-week trend deltas behind the dashboard's time-range control.

After that: surface variants — a **Microsoft Teams tab** (same codebase, Entra SSO) and a **Tauri Mac shell** — all wrapping the one web app.

<!-- 📸 Screenshot slot: Optional teaser — a mock of the planned Genie/Analytics tab, if you want to end on a forward-looking note. -->
